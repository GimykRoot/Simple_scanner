1. A Hidden Garden

Behind the tall iron gates lies a garden that most people in the city have never seen.
It is hidden between two abandoned houses, and from the outside it looks like nothing
more than a patch of neglected land. But once you step inside, you discover a world of green life,
quiet beauty, and secret calmness. The path is covered with moss, and the air carries
the scent of wild roses and mint. Tall trees bend over the narrow trail,
offering shade and a sense of shelter. At the center of the garden there is a stone fountain,
cracked and worn by time, yet water still flows from its mouth, making a gentle, soothing sound.
Birds nest in the branches above, and butterflies hover over the flowers as if they own the place.
For me, this hidden garden has always felt like a personal sanctuary.
I discovered it by accident one summer afternoon, and since then I return whenever I need peace.
The city outside can be loud, restless, and unforgiving. But here, time slows down.
The garden doesnâ€™t care about schedules or noise; it teaches silence.
It is a secret world, and in keeping it hidden, it feels like mine alone.
