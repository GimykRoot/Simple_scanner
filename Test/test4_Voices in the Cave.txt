4. Voices in the Cave

The cave was dark, damp, and endless.
For centuries, no one had dared to explore it fully.
Yet one group of travelers decided to venture inside,
drawn by stories of hidden treasures and ancient carvings left by forgotten people.
At first, all they heard was the sound of dripping water,
echoing endlessly against the stone walls. Their torches illuminated strange shapes,
some natural, some carved by human hands long ago.
The further they went, the stronger the feeling grew that the cave was alive.
The air was heavy, and the silence seemed to press on their chests.
Suddenly, one of the travelers swore he heard a whisper.
At first, the others laughed, thinking it was only the echo of footsteps.
But soon, more voices seemed to rise, faint yet distinct, as if the stones themselves were speaking.
Fear mixed with curiosity, and they continued deeper, searching for the source.
What they found was not gold or treasure, but a vast chamber filled with symbols etched across the walls.
The voices grew louder, filling the space with a strange harmony.
They realized then that the true treasure of the cave was not material
wealth but the forgotten stories it preserved.
